# Plan 05.1-05 Summary: Regulation Impact Flow

## Objective

Create a visualization showing how three key banking regulations transformed the US banking industry, with before/after comparisons and animated transitions.

## What Was Built

### RegulationImpactFlow Component

Created `/src/components/visualizations/diagrams/RegulationImpactFlow.tsx` - an interactive visualization covering three major banking regulations:

**1. Glass-Steagall Act (1933)**
- Before: Universal banks doing everything - deposits, loans, securities, speculation
- After: Strict separation between commercial banks (FDIC insured) and investment banks
- Visual: Split diagram showing the "wall" between separated entities

**2. Riegle-Neal Act (1994)**
- Before: Banks limited to single states with geographic fragmentation
- After: Nationwide banking with interstate branching and acquisitions
- Visual: Map-like view showing single state banks vs. national bank networks

**3. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (1999)**
- Before: Separated commercial banking, investment banking, and insurance
- After: Financial Holding Companies offering all services under one roof
- Visual: Merge diagram showing combination into financial supermarkets

### Features Implemented

- **Tab selector** for navigating between regulations with year indicators
- **Before/After toggle** with smooth animated transitions (AnimatePresence)
- **Visual diagrams** unique to each regulation showing structural changes
- **Impact panel** with pros/cons for each regulation
- **Timeline indicator** showing when each law was enacted
- **Color coding**: Amber (Glass-Steagall), Emerald (Riegle-Neal), Indigo (Gramm-Leach-Bliley)

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/components/visualizations/diagrams/RegulationImpactFlow.tsx` | Created new component |
| `src/components/visualizations/diagrams/index.ts` | Added export |

## Technical Details

- Built using existing patterns from DirectIndirectFinance.tsx
- Uses Framer Motion for smooth transitions between states
- Three sub-components for regulation-specific diagrams:
  - `GlassSteagallDiagram`: Shows separation via visual "wall"
  - `RiegleNealDiagram`: Shows state-bound vs. nationwide banking
  - `GrammLeachBlileyDiagram`: Shows separated entities vs. holding company
- Responsive design with CSS variables for theming

## Verification

- [x] `npm run build` succeeds
- [x] All 3 regulations display correctly with unique visuals
- [x] Before/after toggle animates smoothly
- [x] Impact panels show pros and cons for each regulation
- [x] Visual diagrams clearly show regulatory changes
- [x] Component exported and accessible from index.ts

## Educational Value

This visualization helps students understand:
- How regulation shaped the banking industry structure
- Trade-offs between stability and competitiveness
- Historical context for modern "too big to fail" concerns
- The regulatory pendulum from separation to consolidation
