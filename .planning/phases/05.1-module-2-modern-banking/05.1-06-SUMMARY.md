# Summary: Bank Consolidation Chart

## What Was Built

Created an interactive, animated SVG chart visualizing the dramatic decline in US bank count from 14,400 in 1985 to 4,400 in 2020 - a 69% reduction over 35 years.

## Files Created/Modified

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `src/components/visualizations/diagrams/BankConsolidationChart.tsx` | Created | Main visualization component |
| `src/components/visualizations/diagrams/index.ts` | Modified | Added export for new component |

## Component Features

### Animated Line Chart
- SVG-based responsive chart with viewBox scaling
- Animated path drawing using Framer Motion's `pathLength`
- Gradient area fill under the line for visual depth
- Grid lines and properly labeled axes (Y: bank count in thousands, X: years)

### Interactive Data Points
- Clickable circles at each data point (1985, 1990, 1994, 1999, 2005, 2008, 2015, 2020)
- Hover effects with scale animation
- Selected state with glow filter effect
- Shows detailed info using `AnimatedValue` component for smooth number transitions

### Key Events Marked
- **1985**: Peak bank count (amber marker)
- **1994**: Riegle-Neal Act - interstate banking (green marker)
- **1999**: Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (green marker)
- **2008**: Financial Crisis (red marker)

### Consolidation Drivers
Five interactive driver cards explaining causes:
1. **Technology** (1985-2020): ATMs, online/mobile banking
2. **Competition** (1985-2005): Money market funds, securitization
3. **Deregulation** (1994-2005): Riegle-Neal, GLB Act
4. **Economies of Scale** (1990-2020): Lower costs per customer
5. **Financial Crisis** (2008-2015): Failures and forced mergers

Clicking a driver highlights its active period on the chart by dimming unrelated data points.

### Educational Elements
- Percentage decline calculation from 1985 peak
- Key takeaway box explaining implications (too-big-to-fail, rural access concerns)
- Instruction hints for user interaction

## Technical Implementation

- Uses `motion.path` with `pathLength` for line animation
- SVG gradients for area fill under curve
- `AnimatedValue` component for smooth number counting
- Consistent styling with existing components (glass morphism, CSS variables)
- Full TypeScript types for data structures

## Verification

- `npm run build` - Passed successfully
- Chart animates on mount
- Data points are clickable with visual feedback
- Key events (1994, 1999, 2008) are clearly marked
- Driver cards highlight relevant periods
- Responsive layout works across screen sizes

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { BankConsolidationChart } from '@/components/visualizations/diagrams';

<BankConsolidationChart className="my-8" />
```

## Educational Value

This visualization helps students understand:
- The scale of banking industry consolidation
- The role of legislation (Riegle-Neal, GLB) in enabling mergers
- How technology and competition drove efficiency needs
- The impact of the 2008 financial crisis on bank structure
- Trade-offs between efficiency and systemic risk
