# Phase 3: Module Navigation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A visual showcase where each of the 8 module cards feels exciting and distinct — almost like a gallery of financial concepts. When students land on the home page, they should immediately feel drawn to explore.

Each card shows an interactive preview — a glimpse of what's inside. Maybe a mini animation or key concept that hints at the module's content. This makes the modules feel alive, not like static links.

The overall experience should feel premium: cards that respond satisfyingly to hover and click, smooth transitions, and a sense that this is a high-quality learning experience worth engaging with.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Immediate engagement** — The moment someone lands, they should feel excited to explore the modules
- **Clear orientation** — Students should instantly understand what each module covers from the preview
- **Satisfying interaction** — Hovering/clicking cards should feel premium and responsive (building on the micro-interactions from Phase 2)

All three are equally important — they work together to create the intended experience.

## Specific Ideas

- Cards should show interactive previews (mini animations or key concepts)
- Gallery-like visual showcase rather than utilitarian grid
- Build on the glass morphism and satisfying micro-interactions established in Phase 2
- 8 modules total for the Money and Banking course

## Additional Context

This is a study app for visual learners — the module cards need to make complex financial concepts feel approachable and exciting, not intimidating. The preview interaction is key to drawing students in and helping them understand what they'll learn.
