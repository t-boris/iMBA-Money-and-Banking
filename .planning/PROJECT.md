# iMBA Money and Banking

## What This Is

An interactive web application for studying the Money and Banking course from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Features 8 modules with visual, interactive content designed for visual learners. Modern, minimalist, award-winning design aesthetic with card-based navigation.

## Core Value

Make complex financial and banking concepts crystal clear through interactive visualizations, animated diagrams, and engaging study tools — transforming abstract theory into intuitive understanding.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Card-based navigation for 8 course modules
- [ ] Animated diagrams showing money flows, banking processes, interest rate mechanics
- [ ] Interactive calculators (compound interest, loan payments, present value, etc.)
- [ ] Quizzes and flashcards with local progress tracking
- [ ] Modern, minimalist UI with award-winning design patterns
- [ ] Responsive web design for desktop and tablet
- [ ] Quick reference sections for formulas and key definitions

### Out of Scope

- User accounts/authentication — static site, no login needed for v1
- Backend/database — all data client-side, no server infrastructure
- Native mobile app — web-only, responsive design covers mobile browsers
- Real-time collaboration — single-user study tool
- Content management system — content baked into the build

## Context

- Course: Money and Banking (iMBA program, Urbana-Champaign)
- Target audience: Visual learners who benefit from interactive, graphical explanations
- Content: Will be prepared module-by-module as the app is built
- Design inspiration: Award-winning sites with modern, minimalist aesthetics (Awwwards, CSS Design Awards style)
- 8 modules total, each covering a distinct topic in money and banking theory

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Open to recommendations — prioritize modern tooling with excellent animation/visualization libraries
- **Hosting**: Static site deployment (Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages compatible)
- **Content**: English language, aligned with Urbana-Champaign curriculum

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Static site architecture | No backend needed, simpler deployment, faster performance | — Pending |
| Local storage for progress | Avoids auth complexity while still tracking quiz/flashcard progress | — Pending |
| Module-by-module content creation | Content not ready upfront, build infrastructure first | — Pending |
