# Phase 2: Design System - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

A bold, modern design system with glass morphism effects — think frosted glass elements, blur backgrounds, and layered depth that gives the app a premium, award-winning feel.

The overall aesthetic should feel like Notion: comfortable to read and interact with for long study sessions, with that same sense of flexibility and polish. But with a bolder, more visual flair that makes it exciting to open the app.

Interactive elements need to feel satisfying — buttons, sliders, inputs should have subtle feedback that makes studying feel less like a chore.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Interactive elements that feel satisfying** — Buttons, inputs, sliders with subtle animations and tactile feedback. When you click something, it should feel responsive and polished.
- **Glass morphism aesthetic** — Frosted glass effects on cards and overlays, blur backgrounds, layered depth that creates visual hierarchy without being overwhelming.
- **Notion-like comfort** — Typography and spacing that's comfortable for long study sessions. Not too dense, not too sparse.

## Specific Ideas

- Glass morphism on module cards and interactive elements
- Inspired by Notion's readability and comfortable feel
- Bold/modern overall with vibrant accents
- Satisfying micro-interactions on interactive elements

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

This is a study app for visual learners — the design should make complex financial concepts feel approachable, not intimidating. The glass morphism and modern feel should communicate "this is a premium learning experience" while remaining highly readable for actual studying.
