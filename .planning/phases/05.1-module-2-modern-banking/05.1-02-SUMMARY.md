# Plan 05.1-02 Summary: Banking Evolution Timeline

## Objective
Create an interactive Banking Evolution Timeline visualization showing major events in US banking history from 1870-2008.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Create BankingEvolutionTimeline Component
**File:** `src/components/visualizations/diagrams/BankingEvolutionTimeline.tsx`

Created a horizontal timeline visualization with 9 key banking history events:

1. **1870 - Unit Banking Era Begins**: States restrict banks to single locations
2. **1930 - Great Depression Bank Failures**: Over 9,000 banks fail
3. **1933 - Glass-Steagall Act & FDIC**: Separation of commercial/investment banking
4. **1935 - Golden Age of Banking (3-6-3 Rule)**: Decades of stability
5. **1956 - Bank Holding Company Act**: Regulation of bank ownership
6. **1980 - Consolidation Begins**: Deregulation starts with interest rate ceilings phased out
7. **1994 - Riegle-Neal Act**: Interstate banking permitted
8. **1999 - Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act**: Glass-Steagall repealed
9. **2008 - Financial Crisis**: Global financial meltdown

**Features Implemented:**
- Horizontal timeline with positioned event markers based on actual year
- Era color coding:
  - Pre-regulation (1870-1933): Amber
  - Regulation era (1933-1980): Emerald (stability)
  - Deregulation era (1980-2008): Primary blue
- Click-to-reveal detail panels (mobile-friendly)
- Glass morphism styling with backdrop blur
- Animated event markers with spring transitions
- Era legend at top of visualization
- Close button on detail panel
- Responsive layout with horizontal scroll on mobile

### Task 2: Export BankingEvolutionTimeline
**File:** `src/components/visualizations/diagrams/index.ts`

Added export to barrel file for component accessibility.

## Verification Results
- [x] `npm run build` succeeds
- [x] Component renders without errors
- [x] All 9 timeline events display correctly
- [x] Click reveals detail panel with impact info
- [x] Era colors distinguish periods (amber, emerald, primary)
- [x] Responsive layout with horizontal scroll

## Technical Notes
- Followed MoneyEvolutionTimeline pattern for consistency
- Used year-based positioning for accurate timeline representation
- Colored track segments show era boundaries visually
- Detail panel includes "What Happened" description and "Long-term Impact" section
- Animation delays stagger event appearance for visual polish

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/visualizations/diagrams/BankingEvolutionTimeline.tsx` (created)
2. `src/components/visualizations/diagrams/index.ts` (modified)
