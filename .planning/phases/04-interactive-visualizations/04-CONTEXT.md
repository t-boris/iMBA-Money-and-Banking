# Phase 4: Interactive Visualizations - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Interactive sandbox visualizations where users manipulate variables and watch diagrams respond in real-time. Rather than passive animations, these are explorable — users drag, adjust, and discover how financial systems work.

Different concepts call for different interaction patterns:
- **Sliders and inputs** for concepts like interest rates, time periods, and amounts — adjust a slider, see the immediate visual impact
- **Drag-and-connect** for concepts like money flows between entities — physically move money, connect institutions, build understanding through action

The goal is hands-on exploration that makes abstract financial concepts tangible. When a student changes something, they should immediately see and understand the result.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Instant feedback** — Changes reflect immediately with no lag. Real-time response is crucial for the exploratory feel.
- **Clear cause-effect** — When you change something, it's obvious what happened and why. The relationship between input and output must be crystal clear.
- **Visual simplicity** — Clean, uncluttered diagrams that don't overwhelm. Complexity should be revealed gradually, not dumped all at once.

All three are equally important — they work together to create the intended learning experience.

## Specific Ideas

- Mix of interaction patterns: sliders for some concepts, drag-and-drop for others
- Real-time visual response to user manipulation
- Interactive sandbox approach rather than passive animation
- Diagrams for: money flows, banking processes, interest rate mechanics (per roadmap)

</specifics>

## Additional Context

This is for visual learners studying Money and Banking — the visualizations need to make abstract financial concepts feel concrete and explorable. The interactive sandbox approach should turn "I read about this" into "I played with this and now I get it."

Building on the glass morphism design system from Phase 2, visualizations should feel premium and polished while remaining highly functional.
