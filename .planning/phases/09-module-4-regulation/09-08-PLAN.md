  <name>Task 1: Update glossary with Module 4 concepts</name>
  <files>src/data/glossary.ts</files>
  <action>
  Update src/data/glossary.ts to include Module 4 concepts:

  1. Add import for module4Concepts:
     `import { module4Concepts } from './module4/concepts';`

  2. Add Module 4 examples to the termExamples record. Add ~15 key examples:
     - 'bank-regulation': 'Capital requirements forcing banks to hold at least 8% equity is an example of bank regulation constraining risk-taking.'
     - 'negative-externality': 'When a bank fails, local businesses lose credit access and households lose savings — costs the bank did not consider when taking risks.'
     - 'moral-hazard': 'After FDIC insurance was introduced, some banks took riskier bets knowing depositors would be made whole by the government.'
     - 'deposit-insurance': 'If your bank fails, FDIC pays back your deposits up to $250,000 — so there is no reason to rush and withdraw.'
     - 'bank-run': 'In 2008, customers lined up outside Northern Rock in the UK to withdraw deposits after hearing the bank had liquidity problems.'
     - 'financial-contagion': 'When Lehman Brothers collapsed, money market funds, insurance companies, and other banks all suffered losses from their exposure.'
     - 'ted-spread': 'The TED spread spiked from ~50 basis points to over 450 basis points during the peak of the 2008 crisis, signaling extreme interbank distrust.'
     - 'basel-accord': 'Under Basel III, banks must hold at least 8% capital relative to their risk-weighted assets.'
     - 'risk-weighted-assets': 'Government bonds carry 0% risk weight while corporate loans carry 100% — a $100M government bond portfolio adds $0 to RWA.'
     - 'camels-score': 'A bank scoring poorly on the CAMELS exam may be placed on the confidential Problem Bank List and face restrictions.'
     - 'stress-testing': 'In the annual CCAR test, banks must show their capital would survive a scenario with 10% unemployment and 25% drop in house prices.'
     - 'too-big-to-fail': 'JPMorgan Chase holds over $3 trillion in assets — its failure would freeze credit markets and trigger a global crisis.'
     - 'shadow-banking': 'Money market funds accept deposits and invest in debt securities, functioning like banks but without FDIC insurance or Fed oversight.'
     - 'regulatory-arbitrage': 'By operating as a money market fund instead of a bank, firms avoid capital requirements while offering deposit-like products.'
     - 'systemic-risk-surcharge': 'JPMorgan faces an additional 3.5% capital surcharge on top of Basel minimums due to its systemic importance.'

  3. Add module4Concepts to the glossaryTerms aggregation:
     `...module4Concepts.map((c) => conceptToGlossaryTerm(c, 4)),`

  This will automatically:
  - Create GlossaryTerm entries with id prefix "4-" (e.g., "4-bank-regulation")
  - Use the getTermType function to classify as 'term', 'concept', 'formula', or 'regulation'
  - Include examples from termExamples where matching
  - Sort alphabetically with all other terms
  </action>
  <verify>npx tsc --noEmit passes. Check that glossary now includes Module 4 terms.</verify>
  <done>Glossary includes all ~55 Module 4 concepts with examples for key terms. Total glossary count increased from 148 to ~200+ terms.</done>

  <name>Task 2: Add Module 4 exam questions</name>
  <files>src/data/examQuestions.ts</files>
  <action>
  Add 10 exam questions for Module 4 to the examQuestions array. Follow existing pattern with ExamQuestion type. Questions should cover all major topics with difficulty distribution: 2 easy, 4 medium, 4 hard.

  Module 4 questions (id format: q4-N, moduleId: 4):

  q4-1 (easy): "Why are banks more regulated than most industries?"
  - Options: A) Because they are more profitable B) Because their failure creates systemic spillovers C) Because they are government-owned D) Because they have monopoly power
  - Correct: B (index 1)
  - Explanation: "Bank failures create negative externalities — lost credit, lost savings, taxpayer costs, and contagion to other institutions — that justify government intervention."
  - conceptId: '4-negative-externality'

  q4-2 (easy): "What is the primary purpose of FDIC deposit insurance?"
  - Options: A) To increase bank profits B) To prevent bank runs by guaranteeing deposits C) To replace bank regulation D) To fund government spending
  - Correct: B (index 1)
  - Explanation: "Deposit insurance removes the incentive for depositors to rush and withdraw funds, preventing self-fulfilling bank runs."
  - conceptId: '4-deposit-insurance'

  q4-3 (medium): "What is the difference between microprudential and macroprudential regulation?"
  - Options: A) Domestic vs international B) Individual bank risk vs system-wide risk C) Small vs large banks D) Short-term vs long-term regulation
  - Correct: B (index 1)
  - Explanation: "Microprudential focuses on the safety of individual banks. Macroprudential addresses system-wide risk and spillovers, with stricter requirements for systemically important institutions."
  - conceptId: '4-macroprudential-regulation'

  q4-4 (medium): "What does the TED Spread measure?"
  - Options: A) The difference between stock and bond returns B) The gap between interbank lending rate and Treasury bill rate C) The spread between mortgage rates and deposit rates D) The inflation rate minus GDP growth
  - Correct: B (index 1)
  - Explanation: "TED = Interbank Rate − Treasury Rate. A wide spread indicates banks distrust each other, signaling financial system stress."
  - conceptId: '4-ted-spread'

  q4-5 (medium): "Why does the Basel Accord use risk-weighted assets instead of total assets?"
  - Options: A) To simplify calculations B) To recognize that different assets carry different risk levels C) To reduce bank profitability D) To standardize accounting rules
  - Correct: B (index 1)
  - Explanation: "Risk-weighting ensures banks hold more capital against risky assets (like corporate loans at 100%) and less against safe assets (government bonds at 0%), making capital requirements proportional to actual risk."
  - conceptId: '4-risk-weighted-assets'

  q4-6 (medium): "What are the six dimensions of the CAMELS rating system?"
  - Options: A) Cost, Assets, Management, Efficiency, Loans, Safety B) Capital, Assets, Management, Earnings, Liquidity, Sensitivity C) Credit, Auditing, Monitoring, Equity, Leverage, Stability D) Capital, Activities, Markets, Exposure, Losses, Solvency
  - Correct: B (index 1)
  - Explanation: "CAMELS rates banks on: Capital adequacy, Asset quality, Management quality, Earnings sustainability, Liquidity position, and Sensitivity to market risk."
  - conceptId: '4-camels-score'

  q4-7 (hard): "What problem does the 'Too Big To Fail' doctrine create?"
  - Options: A) It makes small banks more competitive B) It creates moral hazard by encouraging risk-taking in large banks C) It reduces banking system efficiency D) It increases interest rates for consumers
  - Correct: B (index 1)
  - Explanation: "If large banks expect government rescue, they take excessive risks — keeping profits in good times while shifting losses to taxpayers in bad times. This implicit guarantee also gives them cheaper funding."
  - conceptId: '4-too-big-to-fail'

  q4-8 (hard): "What is shadow banking and why is it a regulatory concern?"
  - Options: A) Illegal banking operations B) Bank-like intermediation outside traditional regulation, creating hidden systemic risk C) Online-only banking without branches D) Foreign banks operating without local licenses
  - Correct: B (index 1)
  - Explanation: "Shadow banks (like money market funds, repo markets) perform bank-like functions — illiquid assets funded by demand-like liabilities — but operate with weaker regulation and no safety net, creating fragility."
  - conceptId: '4-shadow-banking'

  q4-9 (hard): "Why might redemption gates on money market funds actually increase run risk?"
  - Options: A) They are too expensive to implement B) Investors run earlier to avoid being locked out C) They reduce fund profitability D) Regulators cannot enforce them
  - Correct: B (index 1)
  - Explanation: "The preemptive run incentive: if investors expect gates may be imposed, they rationally withdraw earlier to avoid being trapped. The tool designed to stop runs paradoxically accelerates them."
  - conceptId: '4-preemptive-run-incentive'

  q4-10 (hard): "What is the purpose of a systemic risk surcharge for G-SIBs?"
  - Options: A) To punish large banks B) To make large banks hold extra capital proportional to their systemic footprint C) To fund deposit insurance D) To prevent banks from growing
  - Correct: B (index 1)
  - Explanation: "The surcharge works like a 'pollution tax' — the more systemic risk a bank creates, the more capital it must hold. This reduces failure probability for banks whose collapse would damage the entire system."
  - conceptId: '4-systemic-risk-surcharge'
