## How This Should Work

Module 1 (Money and Finance) comes alive through interactive visualizations, concept exploration, and calculation tools. The module has four main lessons, each with sub-lessons that build understanding progressively.

**Content Structure:**

### Lesson 1-0: Overview
The "big picture" — what is money, how the financial system works, and how it connects to real economic activity.

### Lesson 1-1: Money and Payments
- **1-1.1: Money and Its Functions** — What makes something "money"
- **1-1.2: The Payments System** — How money actually moves
- **1-1.3: Money and Inflation** — Measuring money and its effects

### Lesson 1-2: The Financial System
- **1-2.1: What Does the Financial System Do?** — Connecting savers to borrowers
- **1-2.2: Financial Markets vs Financial Institutions** — Direct vs indirect finance
- **1-2.3: Banks vs Non-Banks** — Different types of intermediaries
- **1-2.4: Overview of Non-Banks** — Insurance, pensions, funds, GSEs

### Lesson 1-3: Finance and Real Economy
- **1-3.1: Financial Development and Economic Activity** — Why finance matters for growth

**Learning Experience:**
Three types of interactive content:
1. **Animated Diagrams** — Money flows, payment pathways, institutional relationships
2. **Concept Exploration** — Click through definitions, see connections
3. **Calculation Tools** — M1/M2, inflation impact, asset comparisons

Style: Playful animations with money particles flowing, pulsing entities, engaging micro-interactions.

## What Must Be Nailed

All concepts from the course notes need coverage. Key visualizations by lesson:

### Lesson 1-0: Overview
- **Financial System Flow** — Savers → Financial System → Borrowers (the foundational diagram)
- **Three Pillars** — Money | Financial System | Real Economy connections

### Lesson 1-1.1: Money and Its Functions
- **Money Functions Triangle** — Means of Payment, Unit of Account, Store of Value
- **Money Evolution Timeline** — Commodity Money → Representative Money → Fiat Money
  - Historical examples: arrowheads, shells, salt, gold, paper backed by metal, modern fiat
- **Properties of Good Money** — widely accepted, stable value, divisible, portable, hard to counterfeit

### Lesson 1-1.2: The Payments System
- **Payment Methods Flow** — Cash vs Non-Cash pathways
  - Cash: banknotes, coins
  - Non-Cash: Checks → ACH → Debit Cards → Credit Cards → Prepaid → Digital Wallets → P2P Apps
- **Check/Transfer Animation** — Show it's an "instruction to bank" not money itself
- **Payment Evolution** — Cash → Checks → Cards → Mobile → Digital Platforms

### Lesson 1-1.3: Money and Inflation
- **Monetary Aggregates Calculator** — M1 vs M2 with component breakdowns
  - M1: currency + checking accounts
  - M2: M1 + savings + money market funds
- **Liquidity Spectrum** — Rank assets by liquidity (cash → checking → savings → bonds → real estate)
- **Inflation Impact** — Show how CPI changes affect purchasing power
- **Historical Money-Inflation Chart** — 1960s-2000s correlation vs post-2000 weakening

### Lesson 1-2.1: What Does the Financial System Do?
- **Savers-Borrowers Flow** — Detailed flow with financial instruments as bridges
  - Savers: households with excess income
  - Borrowers: households (mortgages), businesses (investment), farmers (equipment), government (infrastructure)
- **Financial Instruments Matrix** — Saver side (deposits, mutual funds, insurance) vs Borrower side (equity, debt)
- **Collateral Concept** — Visual showing secured vs unsecured lending

### Lesson 1-2.2: Financial Markets vs Financial Institutions
- **Direct Finance Path** — Investor ↔ Broker/Dealer ↔ Investor (no balance sheet)
- **Indirect Finance Path** — Saver → Institution (balance sheet) → Borrower
- **Market Types** — Equity Market | Debt Market | Money Market
- **Good Market Criteria** — Low transaction costs, information efficiency, investor protection
- **Three Problems Banks Solve:**
  1. Maturity Mismatch — short deposits → long loans
  2. Price Risk — deposits stable while markets fluctuate
  3. Information Asymmetry — banks specialize in evaluating borrowers

### Lesson 1-2.3: Banks vs Non-Banks
- **Bank Balance Sheet** — Interactive Assets (loans) | Liabilities (deposits)
- **Bank Functions** — Payment infrastructure + savings storage + credit filter
- **Banks vs NBFIs Comparison** — deposits, payment accounts, main function, risk type, regulation

### Lesson 1-2.4: Overview of Non-Banks
- **Non-Bank Ecosystem** — Visual showing all types:
  - Insurance Companies (pool risk, invest premiums)
  - Pension Funds (long-term savings → retirement income)
  - Investment Banks (underwriting, connecting issuers to markets)
  - Investment Funds (mutual funds, ETFs, money market funds, hedge funds)
  - Finance Companies (specialized lending without deposits)
  - GSEs (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac — mortgage market support)
- **Financial Industry Evolution** — 1970 → 2018 shift from banks to mutual funds

### Lesson 1-3.1: Financial Development and Economic Activity
- **Finance-Growth Correlation** — Financial Development vs GDP per capita scatter plot
- **Four Channels** — Capital Allocation | Risk Sharing | Liquidity Provision | Information Production
- **Dark Side** — Financial Fragility → Crisis → Bailout → Moral Hazard cycle
- **Financial Cycle** — Innovation → Credit Expansion → Bubbles → Crisis → Regulation → Stability

2. Financial Depth: Private Sector Credit / GDP

### Exam-Style Questions (hints at tricky concepts):
1. Why aren't credit cards in M1/M2? (It's debt, not money)
2. Why did money-inflation correlation weaken post-2000?
3. How do banks solve Maturity Mismatch? (and why it creates risk)
4. Direct vs Indirect Finance distinction
5. Why do governments bail out banks despite moral hazard?

## Additional Context

**Language:** All content in English (user's notes have Russian explanations but app is English-only)

**Visual References:** Course includes diagrams:
- Money supply components chart
- Money growth vs inflation 1960-1980
- Money growth vs inflation post-2000
- Financial system flow diagram
- Financial industry composition 1970 vs 2018
