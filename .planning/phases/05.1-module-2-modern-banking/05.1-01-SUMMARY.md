# Plan 05.1-01 Summary

## Completed
- Created Module 2 lessons data with 6 lessons (Overview through Modern Bank Revenue)
- Created Module 2 concepts data with 15 key banking terms organized by lesson
- Created Module 2 barrel export file

## Files Modified
- `src/data/module2/lessons.ts` - 6 lessons covering modern banking history and operations
- `src/data/module2/concepts.ts` - 15 concepts with lessonId, definitions, and relatedConcepts
- `src/data/module2/index.ts` - barrel export for module2Lessons and module2Concepts

## Verification
- Build: pass
- TypeScript: pass (npx tsc --noEmit)
- Files: 3 files created in src/data/module2/

## Notes
- The plan template was missing the required `lessonId` field for concepts; added appropriate lessonIds based on course content organization
- Added `relatedConcepts` arrays to connect related banking terms (e.g., Glass-Steagall links to FDIC and Gramm-Leach-Bliley)
- Lessons cover: Overview (2-0), Early Banking (2-1), Bank Holding Companies (2-2), Deregulation (2-3), Consolidation (2-4), Revenue (2-5)
- Concepts organized by lesson: unit banks and Glass-Steagall in 2-1, holding companies and 3-6-3 rule in 2-2, deregulation acts in 2-3, consolidation and TBTF in 2-4, interest spread and fee income in 2-5
