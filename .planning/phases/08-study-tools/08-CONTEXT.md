# Phase 8: Study Tools - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Study Tools is a first-class feature accessible from the header navigation — not buried in a module. When users click "Study Tools" they land on a page with two main sections: Glossary and Exam Practice.

**Glossary** presents terms as a visual card grid. Users can filter by definition type (term, concept, formula, regulation) and by first letter (A-Z index). Clicking a card opens a centered modal with the full definition, examples, and a link back to the source lecture. The grid should feel browsable and organized.

**Exam Practice** is a focused quiz mode. User selects question count (5, 10, 15, or 20) and starts. One question at a time, full screen, timer visible. After answering, immediate feedback shows whether they were right/wrong with an explanation. Questions follow the difficulty distribution: 40% hard, 40% medium, 20% easy.

**Gamification** adds motivation: points for correct answers, streaks for consecutive correct answers, progress badges. Make studying feel rewarding.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Glossary completeness** — Every term from every lecture captured and linked to source
- **Question quality** — Questions that test understanding, not just memorization
- **Study flow** — Smooth experience between glossary lookup and practice
- **Header navigation** — Study Tools as primary nav item, accessible everywhere

</essential>

## Specific Ideas

- Card grid for glossary (not a boring list)
- Modal popup for term details (centered, rich content)
- Focused quiz mode (one question, full screen, timer, immediate feedback)
- Gamified elements: points, streaks, progress badges
- Filter by type AND by letter (A-Z index)
- Difficulty mix: Hard 40%, Medium 40%, Easy 20%
- Question counts: 5, 10, 15, or 20

<notes>
## Additional Context

Study Tools should feel like a reward after going through the module content — a place to reinforce and test knowledge. The gamification should motivate continued practice without feeling childish.

Navigation: Add "Study Tools" link to the site header alongside existing navigation.
